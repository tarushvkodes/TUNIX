# Creating TUNIX - Step by Step Guide
Copyright Â© Tarushv Kosgi 2025

This guide outlines the process for creating a custom Ubuntu-based Linux distribution called TUNIX from scratch. TUNIX aims to provide an enhanced GUI experience while addressing common Linux pain points.

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

1. **Define Your Vision**
   - Document the core objectives of TUNIX (enhanced GUI, simplified configuration, better hardware support)
   - Identify specific pain points to address (UI inconsistency, driver issues, etc.)
   - Define your target audience (new Linux users, professionals, etc.)

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Install Ubuntu LTS on your development machine or in a VM (at least 8GB RAM, 50GB storage)
   - Install required development tools:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git build-essential debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso isolinux
     ```

3. **Create Project Structure**
   - Create and organize your project repository:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p TUNIX/{branding,config,custom-packages,docs,installer,scripts/{build,post-install},ui-enhancements/{desktop-environment,themes,usability}}
     cd TUNIX
     git init
     ```

## Phase 2: Core Components Development

1. **Base System Selection**
   - Select Ubuntu LTS as your foundation (currently Ubuntu 22.04)
   - Document your base system decisions in `docs/base-system.md`

2. **Branding Elements**
   - Design your OS logo, wallpapers, and visual identity
   - Create custom icons and splash screens
   - Place these assets in the `branding/` directory
   - Document branding guidelines in `branding/branding-guide.md`

3. **UI Enhancement Planning**
   - Select a desktop environment to customize (GNOME is recommended)
   - Document your UI philosophy in `ui-enhancements/README.md`
   - Specify desktop customizations in `ui-enhancements/desktop-environment/desktop-spec.md`
   - Define theme requirements in `ui-enhancements/themes/theme-spec.md`

4. **System Configuration**
   - Document your system philosophy in `config/system-philosophy.md`
   - Create custom configuration files for system components
   - Design optimized default settings for power management, security, etc.

## Phase 3: Custom Package Selection and Development

1. **Package Selection**

   - Document key features and differences from Ubuntu
   - Provide troubleshooting information

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Write detailed developer guides for contributors
   - Document your build process thoroughly
   - Create contribution guidelines

3. **Community Building**
   - Set up communication channels for users and developers
   - Create a website for your distribution
   - Establish feedback mechanisms

## Phase 7: Quality Assurance and Release

1. **Testing Process**
   - Test your distribution in various environments:
     ```bash
     # Test in QEMU
     qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -boot d -cdrom tunix-os.iso
     ```
   - Perform hardware compatibility testing
