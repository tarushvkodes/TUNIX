# Creating TUNIX - Step by Step Guide
Copyright Â© Tarushv Kosgi 2025

This guide outlines the process for creating a custom Ubuntu-based Linux distribution called TUNIX from scratch. TUNIX aims to provide an enhanced GUI experience while addressing common Linux pain points.

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

1. **Define Your Vision**
   - Document the core objectives of TUNIX (enhanced GUI, simplified configuration, better hardware support)
   - Identify specific pain points to address (UI inconsistency, driver issues, etc.)
   - Define your target audience (new Linux users, professionals, etc.)

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Install Ubuntu LTS on your development machine or in a VM (at least 8GB RAM, 50GB storage)
   - Install required development tools:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git build-essential debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso isolinux
     ```

3. **Create Project Structure**
   - Create and organize your project repository:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p TUNIX/{branding,config,custom-packages,docs,installer,scripts/{build,post-install},ui-enhancements/{desktop-environment,themes,usability}}
     cd TUNIX
     git init
     ```

## Phase 2: Core Components Development

1. **Base System Selection**
   - Select Ubuntu LTS as your foundation (currently Ubuntu 22.04)
   - Document your base system decisions in `docs/base-system.md`

2. **Branding Elements**
   - Design your OS logo, wallpapers, and visual identity
   - Create custom icons and splash screens
   - Place these assets in the `branding/` directory
   - Document branding guidelines in `branding/branding-guide.md`

3. **UI Enhancement Planning**
   - Select a desktop environment to customize (GNOME is recommended)
   - Document your UI philosophy in `ui-enhancements/README.md`
   - Specify desktop customizations in `ui-enhancements/desktop-environment/desktop-spec.md`
   - Define theme requirements in `ui-enhancements/themes/theme-spec.md`

4. **System Configuration**
   - Document your system philosophy in `config/system-philosophy.md`
   - Create custom configuration files for system components
   - Design optimized default settings for power management, security, etc.

## Phase 3: Custom Package Selection and Development

1. **Package Selection**
   - Create a list of packages to include by default
   - Document package selections with explanations
   - Consider creating a script to install these packages:
     ```bash
     touch custom-packages/package-list.txt
     touch custom-packages/install-packages.sh
     chmod +x custom-packages/install-packages.sh
     ```

2. **Custom Package Development**
   - Identify gaps in existing software
   - Develop custom packages for TUNIX-specific functionality
   - Package your custom applications properly

3. **Repository Setup**
   - Set up a custom repository for your packages
   - Document repository management procedures
   - Create scripts to maintain and update your repository

## Phase 4: Build System Creation

1. **Build Script Development**
   - Create a main build script in `scripts/build/build-tunix.sh`
   - Implement functions for each build step:
     - ISO acquisition
     - Filesystem extraction
     - Customization application
     - Package installation
     - ISO repackaging

2. **Build Configuration**
   - Document build configuration options in `scripts/build/build-config.md`
   - Create configuration files for different build variants (minimal, full)

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Create automated tests for your build process
   - Implement quality assurance procedures
   - Document testing protocols

## Phase 5: Installer Customization

1. **Installer Design**
   - Define your installation process in `installer/installer-spec.md`
   - Customize the Ubuntu installer (Ubiquity) or create your own
   - Design user-friendly installation screens

2. **Post-Installation Scripts**
   - Create scripts for post-installation setup in `scripts/post-install/`
   - Implement first-boot configuration wizards
   - Add welcome screens and tutorials

## Phase 6: Documentation and Community

1. **User Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive user guides
   - Document key features and differences from Ubuntu
   - Provide troubleshooting information

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Write detailed developer guides for contributors
   - Document your build process thoroughly
   - Create contribution guidelines

3. **Community Building**
   - Set up communication channels for users and developers
   - Create a website for your distribution
   - Establish feedback mechanisms

## Phase 7: Quality Assurance and Release

1. **Testing Process**
   - Test your distribution in various environments:
     ```bash
     # Test in QEMU
     qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -boot d -cdrom tunix-os.iso
     ```
   - Perform hardware compatibility testing
   - Get feedback from test users

2. **Release Preparation**
   - Create release notes documenting features and changes
   - Generate checksums for verification
   - Prepare download infrastructure

3. **Distribution**
   - Make your ISO available for download
   - Publicize your release
   - Gather and respond to initial feedback

## Phase 8: Maintenance and Evolution

1. **Update Process**
   - Establish procedures for keeping packages updated
   - Sync with upstream Ubuntu security updates
   - Plan your release cycle

2. **Feature Development**
   - Prioritize new features based on user feedback
   - Create a roadmap for future development
   - Implement continuous improvement processes

3. **Community Management**
   - Grow your contributor base
   - Manage user feedback effectively
   - Build partnerships with other projects
